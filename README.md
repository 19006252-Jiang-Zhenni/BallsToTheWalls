# BallsToTheWalls
Balls to the Walls is a puzzle platformer where you fling/slingshot a bouncy
ball onto walls. The catch, you must hit a wall to fling again. Plan your
route carefully to complete each level.

Each level contains 3 optional stars. You don't have to collect any to win.
But they're great for bragging rights!

There is a level editor where you can build your custom levels! However
the controls are not explained within the editor.
